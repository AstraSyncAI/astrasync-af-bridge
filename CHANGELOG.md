This marks the official production release of the AstraSync AF Bridge for Letta Agent Files!

### Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from v0.1.x (Developer Preview):

1. **Update your installation:**
   ```bash
   npm install --upgrade @astrasync/af-bridge
   ```

2. **Environment variables (optional):**
   - The default API URL now points to production: `https://astrasync.ai/api`
   - If you have `ASTRASYNC_API_URL` set in your `.env`, you can update it to the production URL
   - The bridge's default already points to production

3. **No code changes required** - The AF bridge is backward compatible. All API calls will automatically use the new production endpoints.

4. **Agent Files:** All existing .af files continue to work with the production infrastructure
